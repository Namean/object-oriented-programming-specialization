## Reading: Getting ready for the next course

As you might already know, this course is part of a 5 courses specialisation on Coursera.

The next course in the specialisation will further explore concepts of object-oriented programming and build on top of the MerkerlRex application code that you have written so far.

The work that you have done inside the virtual lab environment will persist across all the courses of this specialisation. You will also find the starter code at the beginning of the next course in case you missed some parts.

**Nevertheless, it is recommended that you back up your files inside the lab environment.**

You will then be able to simply drag your files into the next course virtual lab environment in case something goes wrong.
