## enum

The Enum class.

- [13.4 — Scoped enumerations (enum classes)](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/scoped-enumerations-enum-classes/)
- [Enumeration declaration](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/enum)
- [C++ Enumeration](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/enumeration)

## vector

The std::vector. Note the difference between initialising with curly braces and normal braces.

- [std::vector::vector](https://cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/vector/)
- [Creation and Use of C++ Vector](https://www.bitdegree.org/learn/c-plus-plus-vector)

## classes

The syntax for a class. Information about how to add function members to classes.
Do not worry too much about that for now, we will get into that later!

- [C++ Classes and Objects](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_classes_objects.htm)
- [Class declaration](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/class)

## constructors

Information about constructors, including an explanation of why we were able to use the class even before we had written a constructor (i.e.because the compiler provides a default constructor).

- [Default constructors](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/default_constructor)
- [14.9 — Introduction to constructors](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-constructors/)
- [C++ Constructors](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_constructors.asp)
- [Constructors in C++](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/constructors-c/)

## Member initialiser lists

Member initialiser lists.

- [When do we use Initializer List in C++?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/when-do-we-use-initializer-list-in-c/#:~:text=Initializer%20List%20is%20used%20in,and%20y%20of%20Point%20class)
- [Constructors and member initializer lists](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constructor)
- [14.10 — Constructor member initializer lists](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/constructor-member-initializer-lists/)

## range loops

Examples and further explanation about using references and range loops.
