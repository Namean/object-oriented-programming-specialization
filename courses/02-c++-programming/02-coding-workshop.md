## C++ is strongly typed

In this video we're going to talk about types in C++, because we're going to start modeling some data now and we need to know how we can represent different types of numbers using the C++ language.

We're going to talk about data types

C++ provides stronger type checking than C

So what it means that when you declare a varaible you have to state what type of data you're going to store in that varaible.

There are several types built into C++. You can see we'g
