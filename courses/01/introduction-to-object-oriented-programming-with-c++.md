## [Print a list of options (menu)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cplusplus-crypto-i/lecture/Fg5T2/print-a-list-of-options-menu)

In this video, it's time to start building our currency trading exchange simulation system.

learn all about how curreny exchanges work by building on ourelves.

The riest step is decide, what are the options, what can the user do?

This whole thing is going to be console based. text input, text otut.

So we want to print a menu which gives the user a list of options for what they want to do.

What one fo the menu options going to be?

1. printing the help
2. printing the curernt state of the exchange

- So printing exchange stas

Just to say, if you're consifdering selling some curreny on an exchange or buying some currency on an exchange, key way that you decide how to do that , is by looking at statistics, what's on offer and what are other people offering to buy and what people are selling.

The next thing is to acrtauly go ahead and make an offer, then the counterpart to that make a bid. So as I say we're going to ealrn about how these thigns work as we build it.

In essence on trading systems, an offer is an offer to selel something

10 british pounds for $20
"I'ld like to buy five Britishj pounds for $25,

So a bid is what you'd like to buy, an offer is what you've got to sell.

So the purpose of one of the key features of the exchange is to sets of people together and evaluate who should be selling what to whom based on how much that they put in. So one fot he key parts we're going to develop on the program is that resolution of the trades that are on the platform.

So `offers` and `bids` are key things.

Then we're going to be want to look at wallets. So the wallet is going to be where we store our current assets. So let's say print wallet.

The way I'm going to run this is going to have a concept of time, so it will step through time and then at each time interval, it'll calcualte and resolve all the bids and offers, and then have gone tot he next step.

It'll be using real data, but it will use when you put your ids and offers into that data. So you will figure out whether your bids you could have made money if you are in that real thing when it was running.
