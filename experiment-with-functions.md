# [Experiment with functions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cplusplus-crypto-i/supplement/bm6qC/experiment-with-functions)

Now it is your turn to experiment with functions.

    Write and call some simple mathematical functions.

    Can you separate the function prototypes from the implementations?

    Does your IDE generate errors or warnings if you put a return type on a function then do not return anything?

```cpp
#include <iostream>


void mean() {}
void median() {}
void mode() {}

int main()
{

}


```
