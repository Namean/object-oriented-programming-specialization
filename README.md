In this **5-course** specialisation, you will develop various C++ programming skills. Rather than building many small programs as you will in other courses, we have taken a different approach: you will create a single, extensive program through the five courses. The program will be a

2. [C++ Programming: Classes and Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cplusplus-crypto-ii?specialization=object-oriented-programming-s12n)
3. [Object-Oriented Programming with C++: Functions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cplusplus-crypto-iii?specialization=object-oriented-programming-s12n)
4. [Working with Objects in C++](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cplusplus-crypto-iv?specialization=object-oriented-programming-s12n)
5. [Use C++ to build a Crypto Trading Platform: Final System](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cplusplus-crypto-v?specialization=object-oriented-programming-s12n)

Tips:

We strongly encourage you to keep a log, or journal, of the learning you are undertaking to accompany the stepped learning through the series of courses in the specialisation. This can be as simple as noting down on paper the main concepts you learn at the end of each course. Or you might want to write notes after each video.
